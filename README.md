## üñ•Ô∏è Usage Tips

Use the **Open Directory** button in the sidebar to open a directory containing your Markdown (`.md`) files. If you don't have one yet, you can create an empty directory (e.g., `~/Documents/notes/tech_notes`) and open it. Once opened, you‚Äôll see an option next to the directory name to create new notes.

> [!TIP]
> No Markdown notes yet? Click **"Try with example notes"** after launching!


## ‚ú® How It Works

- **Rendering:** TechNote aims to keep everything explicit and transparent. It simply renders your existing Markdown files as HTML documents. No hidden metadata. No extra files. No surprises. You have full control over your content.
- **Caches:** To improve performance, notes are cached as HTML and updated automatically when you edit them.
- **The database:** TechNote uses a lightweight SQLite database to store minimal metadata ‚Äî such as unique IDs and display names for notes ‚Äî and the paths to selected directories. Deleting the database will **not** affect your notes.
